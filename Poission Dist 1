For beginners in statistics: an explanation of why "X²" is replaced by "mean(X) + mean(X)²" when calculated the expected daily cost.
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
averageX, averageY = [float(num) for num in input().split(" ")]
# Cost
CostX = 160 + 40*(averageX + averageX**2)
CostY = 128 + 40*(averageY + averageY**2)

print(round(CostX, 3))
print(round(CostY, 3))
